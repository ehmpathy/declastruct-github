# blocker.1

src/contract/sdks/.test/assets/resources.apps.acceptance.ts

does not conform to the blueprint

# blocker.2

new DeclastructDao

dont construct new daos directly

use the factory genDeclastructDao instead

it handles refs for us

# blocker.3

dont run crud operations in the acceptance test directly; acceptance tests only need to run the pllan and a
pply via declastruct

look at src/contract/sdks/declastruct.acceptance.test.ts for a template

fix src/contract/sdks/declastruct.apps.acceptance.test.ts to conform


# blocker.4

DeclaredGithubApp.owner

> sounds like the owner could actually be a user right? so should the owner have the same { type, slug }
pattern? should we create a generic literal of DeclaredGithubOwner ?
