# blocker.1

src/domain.operations/appInstallation/castToDeclaredGithubAppInstallation.ts

double check this cast

are we always guaranteed to get the app id looked up in the cast?

we must verify via websearch and api response;

will we be able to get this info reliably


---

# blocker.2

src/domain.operations/app/setApp.ts

are we not able to upload the manifest directly, on behalf of the caller, to make their life easier?

# blocker.3


  /**
   * .what = GitHub's internal app ID
   * .note = is @metadata -> may be undefined
   */
  id?: number;


DeclaredGithubApp has an id; this is its `primary`

set it in the domain entity attributes

also, support getOne by primary for this
