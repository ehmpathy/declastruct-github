wish =

wish we could provision github apps so that we can subsequently use their tokens via this project

e.g.,

short-lived tokens, scoped permissions, auditable.

requires:
- create a GitHub App in org settings
- storing app id + private key as secrets
- using `actions/create-github-app-token` in workflows

e.g.,
- create a GithubApp called `declastruct-github` which has privs to manage repos (e.g., all the privs required for provision/github/declastruct.resources.ts)
- create a GithubApp called `please-release` which has privs to read and write prs & commits (e.g., all the privs required for .github/workflows/release.yml)

and a demo for how to get their short lived token via actions/create-github-app-token
