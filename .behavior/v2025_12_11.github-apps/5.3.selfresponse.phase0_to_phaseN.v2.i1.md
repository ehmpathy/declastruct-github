# Self-Response: Resolving Blueprint Issues v2

## Issues Resolved

### BLOCKER.1: Acceptance test references wrong app slug ✅

**Problem:** `declastruct.apps.acceptance.test.ts:85` expected `github-actions` but resources file declares `declastruct-github-demo-app`

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
expect(appResource.forResource.slug).toContain('github-actions');

// After
expect(appResource.forResource.slug).toContain('declastruct-github-demo-app');
```

**File:** `src/contract/sdks/declastruct.apps.acceptance.test.ts`

---

### NITPICK.1: Missing `examples/resources/github-apps.ts` ✅

**Problem:** Blueprint Phase 7.2 specified this file but it didn't exist

**Fix:** Created `examples/resources/github-apps.ts` with example app and installation declarations using the current structure (`target: { type, slug }` instead of `targetType`/`targetLogin`)

---

### NITPICK.2: Workflow uses @v1 instead of @v2 ✅

**Problem:** `.github/workflows/provision.yml` used `actions/create-github-app-token@v1`

**Fix:** Updated to `actions/create-github-app-token@v2`

---

## Verification

- [x] `npm run test:types` - passes
- [x] `npm run test:unit` - passes
- [x] All blueprint phases verified complete

## Summary

All blockers and nitpicks from the self-review have been resolved. The implementation now fully conforms to the blueprint with the following intentional deviations:

1. **Target structure:** Uses `target: { type, slug }` instead of `targetType`/`targetLogin` (improvement for nested domain literal)
2. **Required fields:** `homepageUrl` and `public` are required on `DeclaredGithubApp` (domain model accuracy)
3. **Import paths:** Some files import from `src/` instead of `dist/` (for type checking during development)
