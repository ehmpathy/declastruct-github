propose a blueprint for how we can implement the wish described
- in .behaviors/v2025_11_22.declastruct-github/0.wish.md
and
- in readme.md

follow the patterns already present in this repo

---

reference this research for background: .behaviors/v2025_11_22.declastruct-github/3.1.research.v1.i1.md

---

note, we'll remove the aws-lambda resources after the implementation


---

emit to .behaviors/v2025_11_22.declastruct-github/3.3.blueprint.v2.i1.md
